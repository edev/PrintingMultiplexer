# Printing Multiplexer

This project aims to solve the problem space of reviewing images and using multiple printers to print them.

The motivation behind this project is the annual Christmas dinner for the [Sharing God's Bounty](http://sharinggodsbounty.com) soup kitchen in Sacramento, California. After eating dinner, families line up to take photos with Santa. A team of dedicated volunteers photographs, proofs, prints, and frames photos. The volunteers use multiple printers to keep the line moving as fast as possible, but without using specialized software, it is difficult to manage more than two printers efficiently. Since the workflow is highly repetitive, this project aims to automate it.

## Current Status

The initial prototype worked beautifully from 2017 to 2019 and is in the `prototype` branch. The prototype failed to print during the dry run in 2022, which prompted the long-overdue development of a production-ready application. This branch holds the last-minute development of what will eventually become said application. The available time to write this project is under 2 days, so it most likely will not be fully production-ready by the time is reaches the `master` branch. Notably, the UI may be minimal and automated testing will most likely be absent at this stage, but they will be added in a subsequent update.
